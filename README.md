# heron_challenge

file overview:
- function.py will hold the implementation to the challenge
- brainstorm.ipynb will be where I brainstorm (easier for me to track and visualize my ideas)
- tests folder
- download dependencies on local env by installing requirements.txt


on mac os

pip3 install pandas
pip3 install matplotlib

what happens if we cancel a subscription and repurchase it again -- how do customers want to categorize that

what if a reccuring payment is done in two parts 

how much they want to weight diff features

4. (bonus) Please discuss the following:
    1. How would you measure the accuracy of your approach? feedback so customers can confrim or reject those flagged as recurring
    2. How would you know whether solving this problem made a material impact on customers? how often they use recurring feature
    3. How would you deploy your solution? cicd for testing and deployment. put in container?
    4. What other approaches would you investigate if you had more time? customers to define their own rules for identifying recurring transactions. ml. time series?
