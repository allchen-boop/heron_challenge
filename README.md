# heron_challenge

file overview:
- function.py will hold the implementation to the challenge
- brainstorm.ipynb will be where I brainstorm (easier for me to write track my ideas and helps if I need to visualize anything)
- tests folder
- to run on local env, download dependencies by installing requirements.txt
